# My personal React app template

Every time I use `create-react-app`, I always find myself spending 10 - 15 minutes just to reconfigure the default app, deleting lines of codes, creating folder structure, rearranging files. Not much work but I hate doing repeated things. That's why I make this template.

As I'm still learning React, I'll make more changes to the template in the upcoming time.
